Secure It Mod is a mod meant to protect your chest's from anyone without a proper key to the chest.
The mod is meant to run with additions of content to the game excluding rendering.
Chests are locked and are still vanilla blocks.


EXTRA DETAILS
--------------------------------
Keys are unique per chest. Shift clicking with them will remove locks and give back a key and lock combo.
Only non vanilla thing in here is the extra items added with mod which are.
	Key
	Key And Lock
	Unlocking Tool named Skeleton Key for fun.
	
Currently this only works with creative spawning. You currently cannot craft a key. I Will have that available after modjam most likely.
